# CS2800

This project is a calculator that implements two styles of notation; Standard notation (1+1) and Reverse Polish notation (9 4 +).

A GUI has been implemented for the user.
To use the calculator, the user must click on either Reverse Polish or Standard radio button on the bottom right. The user must then enter a valid expression in the text field.

After pressing calculate, the answer will appear in the text field.

The project can be run as a maven run configuration using "clean compile javafx:run".
